As I near the end of my undergraduate coursework my worry about the "real world" is at its all time high.  What languages should I know?  What tools should I know how to use?  Will I be able to work well with a huge team?  Can I even sit down and code for eight hours a day, five days a week?  I'm sure that many of my fellow classmates are also in the same predictament.  However, this class has brought some light to the end of the tunnel. I am not going to lie; I initially signed up for this class as it was the only summer class I had not taken.  Senioritis had really kicked in but the first day of class had my attitude turned around.  Instead of treating this class as a requirement for my degree, I started to see how applicable this class was going to be.  Instead of dreading the projects I started to feel that I would actually enjoy doing them as I would be rewarded with hands-on experience as opposed to some assignment that left me with more questions than answers.  Aside from the structure of the class, I also really enjoy Professor Downing.  I've never had him before and his style of teaching has been a delight.  I enjoy the step-by-step process he goes through as he continuously unveils more and more pertinent information without leaving massive gaps to avoid confusion.
